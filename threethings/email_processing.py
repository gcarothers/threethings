Hi there!

Welcome to the 3things status update email workflow awesomeness tool with
power features. Every week you'll get an email from me asking you to tell
me what what you've been doing this week, and what your planning on doing
next week. Just reply to that email and I'll make sure to let everyone else
on your team know what you've been up to.

You can also send me an email at any time before I remind you! I'll keep
track of all the emails you send me in a week and summarize them on Monday
morning.

See you next Friday!
